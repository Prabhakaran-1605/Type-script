//  we can write any javascript code that is valid type script code.
//  Because typescript is built on top of javascript code.
console.log("Hello World!");
var age = 20;
// age = "a",   once variable type has been mentioned we can't change the type of the variable again.


//  if we do compilation of a type script file will get declaration in var, because typescript compilcation will compile type script code into javascript older version code which is es5 ecma script 5. that's why we are getting var keyword after compilation.


// ecma script is a standard or specification , where js is a implementation of that specification
