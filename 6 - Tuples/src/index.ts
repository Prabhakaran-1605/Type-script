let newTuple: [number, string] = [2, "prabhakar"]

//  Tuple is a fixed length array, each element has a particular type.

//  It will be better to restrict our tuple into 2 value anything more than that it will make our code bit difficult to understand.

//  if we compile the tuple we will get arrays.
